# ML Codes - Catagorical Data Set

## What is Categorical Data?
 
Categorical data is a type of data that is used to group information with similar characteristics, while numerical data is a type of data that expresses information in the form of numbers.

Example of categorical data: gender

## Why do we need encoding?

Most machine learning algorithms cannot handle categorical variables unless we convert them to numerical values
Many algorithmâ€™s performances even vary based upon how the categorical variables are encoded

## Categorical variables can be divided into two categories:

Nominal: no particular order
Ordinal: there is some order between values
We will also refer to a cheat sheet that shows when to use which type of encoding.
